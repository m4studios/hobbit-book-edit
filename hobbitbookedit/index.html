I felt these films had "too much," whether it was all the added sideplots, action, new characters, or even the CGI. As a huge fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's book, I decided to edit these movies down to match closer to what was written while also rectifying many common critiques. This project is for both the purist and casual fans alike, with the end result providing a more focused narrative that I find more enjoyable and emotionally impactful.</p>
    <p class="indented-paragraph">
                I initially edited with the book at my side, page by page, starting on June 19th, 2019. After numerous revisions to make the edit seamless for general audiences and feel as professional as possible, I finished on December 24th, 2021. I also worked on two last revision, one in September of 2023 and one released in June of 2024, where I am now fully satisfied with the cut after many years of work.</p>

                    This edit has been updated, I have been reading feedback and perfecting my vision for years. The runtime is still the same, but with several tweaks including improvements to the Smaug section/Lake-town destruction, Thorin's arc, and the final battle.

              <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>1) Be more faithful to <i>The Hobbit</i> by J.R.R. Tolkien</b> while still generally following Peter Jackson’s Middle-earth vision in the areas where it shined. Includes making the story focus on Bilbo, the main quest, and decreasing the numerous references to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, allowing both stories to stand on their own.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>2) Consistent tone</b> as the story progresses from its lighthearted beginning to more serious ending. With this, display a convincing atmosphere with more realistic action, physics, and visuals. This aids in forming a more natural transition from <i>The Hobbit</i> to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> despite the different scope of each story.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>3) Execute with professional film editing techniques</b>, specifically with making smooth audio transitions, maintaining a proper surround sound mix, and keeping intact the pacing, character arcs, and story structure. Work with lossless sources and avoid any unnecessary quality loss.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>4) Stay in Middle-earth as long as possible</b> with our beloved characters, meaning all available footage (theatrical, extended, and deleted) has been considered. Cutting characterization or book-accurate moments just for the sake of runtime is avoided. Hence, <b>this fan edit is categorized as its own "Extended Edition"</b> to justify the runtime just like how <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> had its own extended cuts, though I have not bothered with making a shorter "non-extended" theatrical cut of <i>The Hobbit</i> because most fans want the full experience.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>5) Appeal to all movie fans</b>, regardless of what their prior knowledge is with any of the Middle-earth books or original films. Understanding that I only have access to the limited existing footage, quality films usually need to be more dramatic or faster paced than their book counterpart, and the presentation needs to be cohesive for viewers who have not read the book.</li>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Applied a 35mm film grain overlay throughout the entire edit to reduce the digital look.
                      <li>Reduced saturation/vibrancy and highlights where necessary to tone down the original color grading, offering a more natural look that also blends all three films together.
                      <li>Reduced green levels and bumped up the reds/blues to remove the subtle green tint that varied throughout the original films, for both reasons described above.

Examples that were cut here include Ori’s gross loud burp, Bombur “eating cheese by the block,” or shoving an axe up Smaug's "jacksy."

The heavy handed connections to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> films throughout <i>The Hobbit</i> films felt out of place and unnecessary from my perspective, especially considering my goal of being accurate to the book.

             Cut the second half of the Thorin and Thranduil scene to remove the weird “serpent mouth” transformation. Thus, Thranduil’s response to the insult is removed which originally gave context to it, giving even more reason for me to show the above translated subtitle.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Inserted a line of dialogue where Thorin says <b>"I am sorry I've doubted you"</b> to Bilbo after being freed from the cells. This is from an earlier scene that had to be cut, but works great here to help naturally develop their friendship, especially because this was the point in the book where Thorin began respecting Bilbo. Thorin then orders the Dwarves to listen to Bilbo and compliments him once escaped. I think keeping their friendship at the forefront of this edit is key.

                <li class="list-group-item">Now only Fíli, Kíli, and Thorin go to Ravenhill to try to kill Azog. Bilbo is knocked out, and Dwalin is not present as it created a loose end when Thorin died alone.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Fíli’s death is relatively the same with only a redubbed subtitle, as Azog has no clue about the family structure of Durin's folk in this cut. Kíli is now just killed by an unknown Orc while trying to fight to defend Thorin, with Tauriel not involved.<br><br>

                <li class="list-group-item">Thorin’s final duel has been shortened and the part where Azog fell under the ice and jumped back up has been removed. It was not necessary to have such a drawn out showdown when the build up to this fight has been substantially reduced, and you could also argue it went on too long in the originals.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">After Thorin's nephews both die, Orc reinforcements and war bats show up as we are brought to another ultimate low. A montage of the good guys losing again highlights that war is not glorious, as Bilbo discusses in the book.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Eagle scene recut to remove Radagast as well as digitally erase him from one of the shots.

                <li class="list-group-item"><b>Extended Scenes Kept:</b> Thorin has an additional piece of dialogue at the gate which mirrors the book and we also get another line from Gandalf. At the start of the battle, we see more of the Dwarf army and Thranduil/Dáin fighting, which aids in maintaining the pacing of the battle to account for all the intolerable action I have cut. After Thorin's final charge, we also see some extended clips of the Company fighting Orcs during the rescored "Misty Mountains" montage, and then a few more extended seconds of Beorn fighting at the end.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>Deleted Scenes Added:</b> Dwalin's cut line of dialogue in the throne room where he said "Bilbo is right" has been re-inserted, sourced from the film's trailer. This adds more emotional weight and increases Bilbo's role in the battle and Thorin's redemption.</li>

                <li class="list-group-item">Thranduil’s conclusion is a repurposed and recut scene from earlier in the movie, previously highlighting his motivations to retreat, but now being used as a scene where he reflects on the casualties of war. This is impactful because his fellow Elves would have lived forever if it were not for the battle, perhaps it was not worth it. Thranduil is an intentional mirror to Thorin, both prideful kings who conflict with others, suffered greatly, and grew in the end.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Restructured dialogue in the Bilbo and Gandalf departure scene to reflect the dialogue in the book almost one-to-one. Additionally, this means Gandalf does not mention the ring because he still has no idea Bilbo has it (even if he is suspicious), we see him discover the ring in <i>The Fellowship of the Ring.</i></li>

                <li class="list-group-item">While many flashbacks and sideplots were cut, a lot of footage had potential to be enjoyable in its own right and was decently accurate to the Tolkien lore as described in his other works outside of <i>The Hobbit</i>. All material has been edited under the same philosophies as the main feature. Consistent visual changes applied.

        <li class="list-group-item">I have created my own <b>"Durin's Folk"</b> 3-part series of flashbacks that focuses on Thorin & the Dwarves, giving both more depth to his character and general historical context. These sequences did an adequate job of adapating Tolkien's lore, specifically from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> Appendices.</li>
